# Bonus Calculator App

## Calculates bonuses for employees based on this calculation:
- Those who have a rating of a 2 or below should not receive a bonus.
- Those who have a rating of a 3 should receive a base bonus of 4% of their base annual income.
- Those who have a rating of a 4 should receive a base bonus of 6% of their base annual income.
- Those who have a rating of a 5 should receive a base bonus of 10% of their base annual income.
- If they have 4 employee numbers, this means they have been with the company for longer than 15 years,
and should receive an additional 5%.
- However, if their annual income is greater than $65,000, they should have their bonus adjusted down 1%.
- No bonus can be above 13% total.
